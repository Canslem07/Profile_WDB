    <h1> Hi :) <span class="Name"> I'm Clarence </span> </span> </h1>
    <p> I'm a Network Solutions Architect with an interest in Fullstack Web Development & Cloud Achitecture</p>
    <p> I'm also currently very motivated by self improvement. My main goal is to squeeze as much learning & thinking ;) as possible out of our 86400 seconds a day.</p>
    <p> Improving on focus, reading and comprehension speed, information retention & motivation are my current areas of interest & self-study. </p>
    <p> Rainforests & the natural world are a source of calm & energy for me. I enjoy hiking and relaxing in natural sorroundings. </p>

        <h3>Network Architecture</h3>
        <p>I started my career as a network engineer in around 2004 working in a NOC for a Oil & Gas Service Provider. This was my first exposure to MPLS.</p>
        <p>This ignited a deep interst in Networks & Comunications. I then achieve CCIE R&S #24536 in 2010 and started wroking with Mobile Service Providers Operating and Building Neworks for 2G,3G & 4G services.</p>
        <p>This encompassed the DC, WAN, Wifi-LAN, SP-Wifi, GI-LAN, IX and almost any other part of the services provider business wwhich required connectivity. </p>
        <p>In 2016 I completed my second CCIE SP and also moved to a pre-sales & architecture role working with my customers on future 5G network Architectures. </p>
        <p>I have been involved in landmark deals in Malaysia Architecting & Building IP networks with SDN functionality and Segment Routing Technologies to serve existing 4G CUPS and future 5G requirements.</p>
        <p>I'm also a speaker at the Malaysia NOG (MYNOG). Here is a link to my last segment on future IP Networks <span class="MYNOG"> <a href="https://www.mynog.org/mynog-8-conference-2019/speakers"> MYNOG CONFERENCE 2019 </a> </span></p>
